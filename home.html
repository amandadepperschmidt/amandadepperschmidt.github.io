<p>I have created this personal website as
a means to share my work and creative processes
with others.  I imagine it will go through many
 changes, but it will do just like this for now.</p>
 <p>For those of you who have just found yourselves here, hello!
   My name is Amanda.  I am a creative writer with a BFA in writing
    from the Savannah College of Art and Design.  I am also a student of
     Archival Studies (MAS) at the University of British Columbia.</p>
  <p>Those are just my credentials.  I am currently living in Vancouver,
     British Columbia with my partner, our cat, and our dog.  None of us are
     Canadian.  If you wish to contact me or view any of my work, check out
        the navigation up top!  Thank you for visiting my website, and also for reading this.
